# Feedback UI

This is a simple feedback user interface built using React 18 that allows the user to add, update and delete feedback. It uses a mock REST API with json-server.

This project goes over all of the fundamentals of React and was made with the intention to become more familiar with how React works.

#### All of the below mentioned was covered in the project:

- Components
- JSX
- Props (propTypes, defaultProps, etc)
- State (Component & Global Level)
- Styling
- Handling Events
- Lists & Keys
- Forms
- Context API
- HTTP Requests

---

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
